ï¼ƒmysql_upload 

Function Description:

The . Py file is run through Linux terminal. After inputting the necessary information, you can directly upload the data of csv, txt and other file formats to the corresponding table of MySQL database, saving time and improving efficiency!

Be careful:

1. It involves the command of modifying user authority and file authority, which needs to be run at the terminal. Do not use if you are sensitive to permission modification!

2. The data table of CSV and txt files to be added does not need the field name. The field name and corresponding data type can be written in the SQL statement when creating the table.
